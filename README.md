# BiblioTech

BiblioTech is a library management file-handling program. It allows the user to enter records of new books and also to access the details of all the books available in the library. In addition, the program maintains a record of all books issued to students. A late fine is charged if a student returns the book after the due date. A student is allowed to borrow a book once the previous book has been returned.
